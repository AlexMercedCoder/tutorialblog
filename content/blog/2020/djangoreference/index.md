## Basic Commands

Start a new project
`django-admin startproject <projectname>`

Start a new app in your project
`django-admin startapp <appName>`

Make Migration Files for Unmigrated Changes
`python manage.py makemigrations`

Run Migrations
`python manage.py migrate`

Run Development Server
`python manage.py runserver`

Create Superuser for Admin Panel
`python manage.py createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --username admin`

## Setting up the Database for Postgres

Need a psychopg2 installed to use postgres

`pip install psycopg2`

_note: You may need to install the following for psycopg2 to install correct, google their installation, not needed for windows sudo "python3-dev" "libpq-dev"_

**NOTE: if using Heroku you can avoid setting all these settings as the django-heroku library will setup all the postgres settings when deployed so you can use SQLite locally guilt free**

**The database configuration in settings.py**

```python
# Database
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/settings/#databases

DATABASES = {

    'default': {

        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',

        'NAME': 'test',

        'USER': 'test',

        'PASSWORD': 'test',

        'HOST': 'localhost',

        'PORT': '5432',

    }

}

```

## Using a .env file with django

**Note: If deploying to heroku, you may not need this and it may cause errors because no .env file is present in production causing an attempt to access .env file to fail (you could wrap it in a conditional). The django-heroku library will make sure all your heroku config vars are available to your application**

Install django-environ

`pip install django-environ`

Add the following to your settings.py, create the .env file in the same folder as your settings.py

```python
import environ

env = environ.Env()
# reading .env file
environ.Env.read_env()
```

DOCS: https://github.com/joke2k/django-environ

**Using env variables in your code**

`env("ENV_VARIABLE")`

`env("ENV_VARIABLE", default="my default value")`

## Deploying to Heroku

### Step 1 - Adjust your database settings (optional, django-heroku will override you settings.py to work with heroku postgres)

```python
DATABASES = {

    'default': env.db()

}

```

\*If you want to use your local database add an ENV variable, DATABASE_URL with using the db string template below

`postgres://YourUserName:YourPassword@YourHost:5432/YourDatabase`

Should look like this in your .env

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://test:test@localhost:5432/test`

### Setup Your gitignore

Include this in your .gitignore in your root directory, this was generated using the site gitignore.io, a website for generating common gitignore entries.

### Gunicorn, Procfile, runtime.txt and requirements.txt

We need Gunicorn to run our app's server so 

`pip install gunicorn`

create a file called "Procfile" in your project root with the following.

`web: gunicorn project.wsgi`

*project should be replaced with your projects name (the name of the folder your settings.py is in)

**ALSO MAKE SURE TO MAKE A runtime.txt WITH YOUR PYTHON VERSION, HEROKU MAY DEFAULT AN EARLIER VERSION OF PYTHON FROM WHICH PIP MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INSTALL THE EXACT VERSION OF YOUR LIBRARIES FROM requirements.txt**

runtime.txt
```
python-3.9.0
```

to create the requirements.txt run this file while in the virtual environment for your project. Make sure to regenerate this file as you add and subtract libraries to your project.

```pip freeze > requirements.txt```

**Procfile, requirements.txt and runtime.txt should all be in the root of your project which is the folder with manage.py**

### Download django-heroku

install django-heroku
`pip install django-heroku`

add the following at the TOP of your settings.py
`import django_heroku`

add the following at the bottom of your settings.py
`django_heroku.settings(locals())`

\*What this will do is configure your project automatically for Heroku when you deploy it

### Push up to github

Create new github repository, and push to github. The ROOT of your repository should be the folder with the manage.py inside it.

### Create a new Heroku Project

- Create a New Heroku Project

- Go to the resources tab and provision a new free postgres database

- Go to the deploy tab and connect your github repository to heroku

- enable automatic deployments

- do an initial deploy hitting the manual deploy button

- Don't forget to run makemigrations and migrate, (easily done in ```Heroku run bash```)

## Django Rest Framework Reference

### Install

`pip install djangorestframework`

then add the following to your settings.py installed apps array

```'rest_framework',```

**ALSO MAKE SURE YOUR APP IS INSTALLED AS WELL**

### Make a model

In a new app make a new model in ```models.py```.
*model field reference => https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/#model-field-types*

```python
from django.db import models


class Dog(models.Model):

    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = models.IntegerField()

    class Meta:
        verbose_name_plural = 'dogs'

```

### Setup Models and Serializers in your app

In your app folder create a ```serializers.py``` with the following.

**The Serializer handles taking your objects data and turning it into JSON**

```python
from .models import Dog
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
from rest_framework import serializers


class DogSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Dog
        fields = ['name', 'age']

class UserSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['url', 'username', 'email', 'groups']

class GroupSerializer(serializers.HyperlinkedModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Group
        fields = ['url', 'name']
```

*Users and Groups are serialized so we have a restful routes for the built in User and Group models*

### Create Views for your API

**Viewsets have all the functions neccessary for RESTFul routes ready to go they just need to be connected to your model and related serializer**

In your apps views.py create the following

```python
from .models import Dog
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework import permissions
from .serializers import DogSerializer, UserSerializer, GroupSerializer


class DogViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    API endpoint that allows users to be viewed or edited.
    """
    queryset = Dog.objects.all()
    serializer_class = DogSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.AllowAny] #Coule be [permissions.IsAuthenticated]

class UserViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    API endpoint that allows users to be viewed or edited.
    """
    queryset = User.objects.all().order_by('-date_joined')
    serializer_class = UserSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]


class GroupViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    API endpoint that allows groups to be viewed or edited.
    """
    queryset = Group.objects.all()
    serializer_class = GroupSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
```
For Details on different permission sets:
- https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/permissions/
- https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/

### Setup URLS

Now to setup the urls for our API in the urls.py in the folder that holds our settings.py.

**The router knows how to create conventional routes and connect them to the right functions in your ViewSet**

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
from rest_framework import routers
from project1.api import views

router = routers.DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'dogs', views.DogViewSet)
router.register(r'users', views.UserViewSet)
router.register(r'groups', views.GroupViewSet)

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include(router.urls)),
    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls', namespace='rest_framework')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```
*For more on how the router works, https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/routers/*

### Finish Up

- make migrations
- migrate
- test

## Adding JWT Authentication to your application

### Download the django simple jwt library

`pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt`

### Add JWT Authenticator to Settings.py

In settings.py add...

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    )
}
```

### Add Route to get and refresh tokens

add the following routes in your urls.py

```python
from rest_framework_simplejwt.views import (
    TokenObtainPairView,
    TokenRefreshView,
)

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('api/token/', TokenObtainPairView.as_view(), name='token_obtain_pair'),
    path('api/token/refresh/', TokenRefreshView.as_view(), name='token_refresh'),
    ...
]
```

### Update your model views that you want to have permissions

```python
from .models import Dog
from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework import permissions
from .serializers import DogSerializer
from rest_framework_simplejwt import authentication # <=add this



class DogViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """
    API endpoint that allows users to be viewed or edited.
    """
    queryset = Dog.objects.all()
    serializer_class = DogSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated] # <= update this
    authentication_classes = (authentication.JWTAuthentication,)# <= add this

```

With this you can pass username and password to api/token/ to get your token, then pass it in the headers to access routes for models with protected views. Keep in mind, for this library it seems to expect a capital "Bearer" in your Authorization header value.
