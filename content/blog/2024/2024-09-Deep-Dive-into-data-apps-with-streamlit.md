    img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

    # Make prediction
    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    results = decode_predictions(predictions, top=3)[0]

    # Display predictions
    st.write("Top Predictions:")
    for i, res in enumerate(results):
        st.write(f"{i+1}. {res[1]}: {round(res[2]*100, 2)}%")
```

Explanation: Users can upload an image, and the app displays the top predictions from the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.

### Using PyTorch
#### Loading a Pre-trained Model
```python
import streamlit as st
import torch
from torchvision import models, transforms

# Load a pre-trained ResNet model
model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
model.eval()

st.write("PyTorch model loaded successfully.")
```
#### Making Predictions
```python
from PIL import Image
import torchvision.transforms as T

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload an image", type=["jpg", "jpeg", "png"])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    # Load and preprocess the image
    image = Image.open(uploaded_file)
    st.image(image, caption='Uploaded Image', use_column_width=True)

    preprocess = T.Compose([
        T.Resize(256),
        T.CenterCrop(224),
        T.ToTensor(),
        T.Normalize(
            mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], 
            std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        )
    ])
    img_t = preprocess(image)
    batch_t = torch.unsqueeze(img_t, 0)

    # Make prediction
    with torch.no_grad():
        out = model(batch_t)
    probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)

    # Load labels
    with open("imagenet_classes.txt") as f:
        labels = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]

    # Show top 3 predictions
    top3_prob, top3_catid = torch.topk(probabilities, 3)
    st.write("Top Predictions:")
    for i in range(top3_prob.size(0)):
        st.write(f"{i+1}. {labels[top3_catid[i]]}: {round(top3_prob[i].item()*100, 2)}%")
```

Note: Ensure that the imagenet_classes.txt file is available in your working directory.

### Building a Simple Prediction App with scikit-learn
Let's build a simple regression app using scikit-learn.

#### Training a Model
```python
import streamlit as st
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load dataset
data = load_boston()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

st.write("Model trained successfully.")
```

#### Making Predictions with User Input

```python
import numpy as np

st.header("Boston Housing Price Prediction")

# Feature input sliders
CRIM = st.number_input('Per capita crime rate by town', min_value=0.0, value=0.1)
ZN = st.number_input('Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.', min_value=0.0, value=0.0)
# ... add inputs for other features

# For brevity, we'll use default values for the rest of the features
input_features = np.array([[CRIM, ZN] + [0]*(X.shape[1]-2)])

# Predict
prediction = model.predict(input_features)
st.write(f"Predicted median value of owner-occupied homes: ${prediction[0]*1000:.2f}")
```
Explanation: Users can input values for features, and the app predicts housing prices.
### Visualizing Model Outputs and Performance Metrics
Visualizations help in understanding model performance.

#### Displaying Metrics
```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Predict on test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate metrics
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Display metrics
st.write("Model Performance on Test Set:")
st.write(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.2f}")
st.write(f"R² Score: {r2:.2f}")
```
#### Plotting Actual vs. Predicted Values
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'Actual': y_test, 'Predicted': y_pred})

st.write("Actual vs. Predicted Values")
st.line_chart(df)
```
Explanation: The line chart shows how closely the model's predictions match the actual values.
### Tips for Integrating Machine Learning Models in Streamlit

**Model Serialization:** For complex models, consider saving and loading models using joblib or pickle to avoid retraining every time.

```python
import joblib

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, 'model.joblib')

# Load model
model = joblib.load('model.joblib')
Use Caching for Models: Cache the model loading or training functions to improve performance.

python
Copy code
@st.cache_resource
def load_model():
    # Load or train model
    return model
```

**Handle Large Models:** Be mindful of resource limitations. Use efficient data structures and consider offloading heavy computations.

**Provide Clear Instructions:** Guide users on how to interact with the app, especially when expecting specific input formats.

### Summary
In this section, you've learned how to:

- Load and use pre-trained models with TensorFlow and PyTorch in your Streamlit apps.
- Build a simple prediction app using scikit-learn.
- Collect user input to make predictions and display results.
- Visualize model outputs and performance metrics to evaluate model effectiveness.

By integrating machine learning models into your Streamlit applications, you can create powerful tools that make complex models accessible to end-users in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

# Database Connectivity

In many data science projects, interacting with databases is essential for retrieving, processing, and storing data. Streamlit, combined with the powerful libraries included in the Python Data Science Notebook Docker Image, makes it straightforward to connect to various databases and integrate them into your applications. In this section, we'll explore how to connect to databases using `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2`, and specifically how to interact with **Dremio** using the `dremio-simple-query` library.

## Connecting to Dremio Using `dremio-simple-query`

**Dremio** is a data lakehouse platform that enables you to govern, join, and accelerate queries across various data sources such as Iceberg, Delta Lake, S3, JSON, CSV, RDBMS, and more. The `dremio-simple-query` library simplifies querying a Dremio source using Apache Arrow Flight, providing performant data retrieval for analytics.

### Installing the `dremio-simple-query` Library

First, ensure that the `dremio-simple-query` library is installed in your environment:

```bash
pip install dremio-simple-query
```

### Setting Up the Connection to Dremio
To connect to Dremio, you'll need to obtain your Dremio Arrow Flight endpoint and an authentication token.

#### Obtaining the Arrow Flight Endpoint
- **Dremio Cloud (NA):** `grpc+tls://data.dremio.cloud:443`
- **Dremio Cloud (EU):** `grpc+tls://data.eu.dremio.cloud:443`
- **Dremio Software (SSL):** `grpc+tls://<ip-address>:32010`
- **Dremio Software (No SSL):** `grpc://<ip-address>:32010`

### Getting Your Authentication Token
- **Dremio Cloud:** Obtain the token from the Dremio interface or via the REST API.
- **Dremio Software:** Obtain the token using the REST API.

You can use the `get_token` function from the `dremio-simple-query` library to retrieve the token programmatically.

### Connecting to Dremio
```python
import streamlit as st
from dremio_simple_query.connect import get_token, DremioConnection
from os import getenv
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from a .env file (optional)
load_dotenv()

# Retrieve Dremio credentials and endpoints
username = st.secrets["dremio_username"]
password = st.secrets["dremio_password"]
arrow_endpoint = st.secrets["dremio_arrow_endpoint"]  # e.g., "grpc+tls://data.dremio.cloud:443"
login_endpoint = st.secrets["dremio_login_endpoint"]  # e.g., "https://your-dremio-server:9047/apiv2/login"

# Get authentication token
payload = {
    "userName": username,
    "password": password
}
token = get_token(uri=login_endpoint, payload=payload)

# Establish connection to Dremio
dremio = DremioConnection(token, arrow_endpoint)

# Test the connection
try:
    st.success("Successfully connected to Dremio.")
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Failed to connect to Dremio: {e}")
```
Note: Ensure that you securely manage your credentials using Streamlit's secrets management or environment variables.

### Querying Data from Dremio
You can now query data from Dremio and retrieve it in various formats.

#### Retrieving Data as an Arrow Table
```python
# Query data and get a FlightStreamReader object
stream = dremio.toArrow("SELECT * FROM your_space.your_table LIMIT 100")

# Convert the stream to an Arrow Table
arrow_table = stream.read_all()

# Optionally, display the data in Streamlit
df = arrow_table.to_pandas()
st.write("Data from Dremio:")
st.dataframe(df)
```
#### Retrieving Data as a Pandas DataFrame
```python
# Directly get a Pandas DataFrame
df = dremio.toPandas("SELECT * FROM your_space.your_table LIMIT 100")
st.write("Data from Dremio:")
st.dataframe(df)
```
#### Retrieving Data as a Polars DataFrame
```python
# Get a Polars DataFrame
df_polars = dremio.toPolars("SELECT * FROM your_space.your_table LIMIT 100")
st.write("Data from Dremio (Polars DataFrame):")
st.write(df_polars)
```

### Querying with DuckDB
You can leverage DuckDB for in-memory analytics on the data retrieved from Dremio.

#### Using the DuckDB Relation API
```python
# Retrieve data as a DuckDB relation
duck_rel = dremio.toDuckDB("SELECT * FROM your_space.your_table LIMIT 100")

# Perform queries on the DuckDB relation
result = duck_rel.filter("column_name > 50").df()

# Display the result
st.write("Filtered Data using DuckDB:")
st.dataframe(result)
```

#### Querying Arrow Objects with DuckDB
Alternatively, you can query Arrow Tables using DuckDB:

```python
import duckdb

# Get data from Dremio as an Arrow Table
stream = dremio.toArrow("SELECT * FROM your_space.your_table LIMIT 100")
arrow_table = stream.read_all()

# Create a DuckDB connection
con = duckdb.connect()

# Register the Arrow Table with DuckDB
con.register("dremio_table", arrow_table)

# Perform SQL queries using DuckDB
query = "SELECT * FROM dremio_table WHERE column_name > 50"
result = con.execute(query).fetch_df()

# Display the result
st.write("Filtered Data using DuckDB on Arrow Table:")
st.dataframe(result)
```

### Best Practices for Using Dremio with Streamlit
- **Secure Credentials:** Always handle your Dremio credentials securely. Use Streamlit's secrets management or environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Optimize your SQL queries to retrieve only the necessary data. Use LIMIT clauses and filters to reduce data transfer and improve performance.
- **Error Handling:** Implement try-except blocks to manage exceptions and provide informative error messages to users.
- **Environment Configuration:** Ensure that your arrow_endpoint and login_endpoint are correctly configured based on your Dremio deployment (Cloud or Software, with or without SSL).

### Connecting to Databases Using sqlalchemy and psycopg2
In addition to Dremio, you might need to connect to other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL. The Docker image comes with sqlalchemy, psycopg2-binary, and other database drivers pre-installed.

#### Setting Up a Connection to a PostgreSQL Database
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd

# Database connection parameters
DB_USER = st.secrets["db_user"]
DB_PASSWORD = st.secrets["db_password"]
DB_HOST = st.secrets["db_host"]
DB_PORT = st.secrets["db_port"]
DB_NAME = st.secrets["db_name"]

# Create a database engine
engine = create_engine(f'postgresql+psycopg2://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}')

# Test the connection
try:
    with engine.connect() as connection:
        st.success("Successfully connected to the PostgreSQL database.")
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Failed to connect to the database: {e}")
```
#### Querying Data from the Database
```python
# Sample query
query = "SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 10"

# Execute the query and load data into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Display the data
st.write("Data from PostgreSQL:")
st.dataframe(df)
```
### Handling Large Datasets with Dask
When dealing with large datasets, performance can become an issue. Dask is a parallel computing library that integrates with Pandas to handle larger-than-memory datasets efficiently.

#### Using Dask to Query Large Tables
```python
Copy code
import dask.dataframe as dd

# Read data from SQL using Dask
df = dd.read_sql_table(
    table='large_table',
    uri=f'postgresql+psycopg2://{DB_USER}:{DB_PASSWORD}@{DB_HOST}:{DB_PORT}/{DB_NAME}',
    index_col='id'
)

# Perform computations with Dask DataFrame
filtered_df = df[df['value'] > 100]

# Compute the result and convert to Pandas DataFrame
result = filtered_df.compute()

# Display the result
st.write("Filtered Data:")
st.dataframe(result)
```
### Best Practices for Database Connectivity
- **Secure Credentials:** Use Streamlit's secrets management or environment variables to store sensitive information.
- **Parameterized Queries:** Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- **Connection Management:** Use context managers (with statements) to ensure connections are properly closed.
- **Error Handling:** Implement try-except blocks to handle exceptions and provide user-friendly error messages.
- **Limit Data Fetching:** When displaying data in the app, limit the number of rows fetched to prevent performance issues.

### Summary
In this section, you've learned how to:

- Connect to Dremio using the dremio-simple-query library and retrieve data efficiently using Apache Arrow Flight.
- Query data from Dremio and convert it into various formats such as Arrow Tables, Pandas DataFrames, Polars DataFrames, and DuckDB relations.
- Utilize DuckDB for in-memory analytics on data retrieved from Dremio.
- Connect to other databases like PostgreSQL using sqlalchemy and psycopg2.
- Handle large datasets efficiently using Dask.
Implement best practices for secure and efficient database connectivity.

By integrating Dremio and other data systems into your Streamlit applications, you can create powerful data-driven apps that interact with live data sources, enabling real-time analysis and insights.

# Deploying Streamlit Apps

With your Streamlit app developed and tested within the Docker environment, the next step is to deploy it so that others can access and use it. Deploying Streamlit apps can be done in several ways, including running the app locally, containerizing it with Docker, and deploying it to cloud platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud, Heroku, AWS, or other hosting services.

In this section, we'll explore how to:

- **Run your Streamlit app outside of Jupyter Notebook**
- **Containerize your Streamlit app with Docker**
- **Deploy your app to cloud platforms**

## Running Streamlit Apps Outside of Jupyter Notebook

# Best Practices and Tips

Developing Streamlit applications involves not just coding but also adhering to best practices that ensure your app is efficient, maintainable, and user-friendly. In this section, we'll cover some essential tips and best practices to help you optimize your Streamlit apps.

## Organizing Your Streamlit Codebase

A well-organized codebase enhances readability and maintainability, especially as your application grows in complexity.

### Use Modular Code Structure

- **Separate Concerns**: Break down your code into modules or scripts based on functionality, such as data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and utility functions.
- **Create a `components` Module**: Encapsulate reusable UI components in a separate module to avoid code duplication.

```python
  # components.py
  import streamlit as st

  def sidebar_filters():
      st.sidebar.header("Filters")
      # Add filter widgets
```

```python
# main app.py
import streamlit as st
from components import sidebar_filters

sidebar_filters()
# Rest of your app code
```

### Follow Naming Conventions
- **Consistent Naming:** Use meaningful variable and function names that follow Python's naming conventions.
- **Folder Structure:** Organize files into folders such as data, models, utils, and pages if using Streamlit's multipage apps.

### Use Virtual Environments
- **Environment Isolation:** Use virtual environments (e.g., venv, conda, or pipenv) to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
Version Control
- **Git:** Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with others.

- **.gitignore:** Include a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from your repository.

```text
__pycache__/
.DS_Store
venv/
.env
```
### Enhancing User Experience with Custom Themes and Layouts
A polished UI enhances the user experience and makes your app more engaging.

#### Custom Themes
- **Streamlit Themes:** Customize the appearance of your app using Streamlit's theming options.

- **Modify config.toml:** Create a `.streamlit/config.toml` file to define your theme settings.

```toml
Copy code
[theme]
primaryColor="#6eb52f"
backgroundColor="#f0f0f5"
secondaryBackgroundColor="#e0e0ef"
textColor="#262730"
font="sans serif"
```
### Responsive Layouts
**Use Columns and Containers:** Organize content using `st.columns()`, `st.container()`, and `st.expander()` for a clean layout.

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.header("Section 1")
    # Content for section 1

with col2:
    st.header("Section 2")
    # Content for section 2
```

### Interactive Elements
**Feedback:** Use `st.progress()`, `st.spinner()`, and `st.toast()` to provide feedback during long computations.

```python
with st.spinner('Loading data...'):
    df = load_data()
st.success('Data loaded successfully!')
```

**Tooltips and Help Text:** Add tooltips or help text to widgets to guide users.

```python
st.text_input("Username", help="Enter your user ID assigned by the administrator")
```

### Accessibility
**Alt Text for Images:** Use the caption parameter in `st.image()` to provide descriptions.

```python
st.image('chart.png', caption='Sales over time')
```

**Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure that all interactive elements can be navigated using the keyboard.


### Debugging Common Issues in Streamlit Apps
Being able to identify and fix issues quickly is crucial for smooth app development.

#### Common Issues and Solutions

##### App Crashes or Freezes

- Infinite Loops: Ensure that your code doesn't have infinite loops that can block the app.
Large Data Loading: Use caching with @st.cache_data to prevent reloading data on every interaction.

##### Slow Performance

- Heavy Computations: Optimize code by using efficient algorithms or leveraging libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
- Caching: Use @st.cache_data and @st.cache_resource to cache expensive operations.
Widget State Not Preserved
- Session State: Use st.session_state to maintain state across interactions.

```python
if 'counter' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.counter = 0

increment = st.button('Increment')
if increment:
    st.session_state.counter += 1

st.write(f"Counter: {st.session_state.counter}")
```

### Errors When Deploying

**Dependency Mismatches:** Ensure that all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt and versions are compatible.

**Environment Variables:** Check that all required environment variables are set in the deployment environment.

### Streamlit Version Issues

**API Changes:** If you encounter deprecated functions, update your code to match the latest Streamlit API.

**Version Pinning:** Specify the Streamlit version in your requirements.txt to maintain consistency.

```text
streamlit==1.25.0
```

### Logging and Error Tracking
##### Use Logging

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.info("This is an info message")
```
##### Display Errors

Use `st.error()` to display error messages to the user.

```python
try:
    result = perform_calculation()
    st.write(result)
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
### Testing
**Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for your functions using unittest or pytest.
**Test Scripts:** Create test scripts to simulate user interactions and verify app behavior.

### Performance Optimization
Optimizing your app's performance ensures a better user experience.

### Efficient Data Handling
**Lazy Loading:** Load data only when necessary, perhaps in response to user input.
**Data Sampling:** For large datasets, consider using a sample for initial display and provide options to load more data.

### Use of Caching
##### Cache Data Loading

```python
@st.cache_data
def load_data():
    # Load data from source
    return data
```

##### Cache Computations

```python
@st.cache_data
def compute_expensive_operation(params):
    # Perform computation
    return result
```

### Optimize Resource Usage
**Avoid Redundant Computations:** Structure code to prevent unnecessary re-execution of functions.

**Clear Session State When Needed:** Manage st.session_state to free up memory if variables are no longer needed.

### Security Considerations
Ensure your app is secure, especially when handling sensitive data.

**Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs.

**Secrets Management:** Use Streamlit's secrets management to handle API keys and passwords.

```python
import os

API_KEY = st.secrets["api_key"]
```

**HTTPS:** Deploy your app using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
