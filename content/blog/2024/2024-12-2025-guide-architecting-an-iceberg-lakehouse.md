With these developments in mind, it's the perfect time to reflect on how to architect an Apache Iceberg lakehouse. This guide aims to help you design a lakehouse that takes full advantage of Iceberg's capabilities and the latest industry innovations.

## Why an Apache Iceberg Lakehouse?

Before we dive into the *how*, let’s take a moment to reflect on the *why*. A lakehouse leverages open table formats like **Iceberg**, **Delta Lake**, **Hudi**, and **Paimon** to create data warehouse-like tables directly on your data lake. The key advantage of these tables is that they provide the transactional guarantees of a traditional data warehouse without requiring data duplication across platforms or teams. 

This value proposition is a major reason to consider Apache Iceberg in particular. In a world where different teams rely on different tools, Iceberg stands out with the largest ecosystem of tools for reading, writing, and—most importantly—managing Iceberg tables. 

Additionally, recent advancements in portable governance through catalog technologies amplify the benefits of adopting Iceberg. Features like **hidden partitioning** and **partition evolution** further enhance Iceberg’s appeal by maximizing flexibility and simplifying partition management. These qualities ensure that you can optimize your data lakehouse architecture for both performance and cost.

## Pre-Architecture Audit

Before we begin architecting your Apache Iceberg Lakehouse, it’s essential to perform a self-audit to clearly define your requirements. Document answers to the following questions:

1. **Where is my data currently?**  
   Understanding where your data resides—whether on-premises, in the cloud, or across multiple locations—helps you plan for migration, integration, and governance challenges.

2. **Which of my data is the most accessed by different teams?**  
   Identifying the most frequently accessed datasets ensures you prioritize optimizing performance for these critical assets.

3. **Which of my data is the highest cost generator?**  
   Knowing which datasets drive the highest costs allows you to focus on cost-saving strategies, such as tiered storage or optimizing query performance.

4. **Which data platforms will I still need if I standardize on Iceberg?**  
   This helps you assess which existing systems can coexist with Iceberg and which ones may need to be retired or reconfigured.

5. **What are the SLAs I need to meet?**  
   Service-level agreements (SLAs) dictate the performance, availability, and recovery time objectives your architecture must support.

6. **What tools are accessing my data, and which of those are non-negotiables?**  
   Understanding the tools your teams rely on—especially non-negotiable ones—ensures that the ecosystem around your Iceberg lakehouse remains compatible and functional.

7. **What are my regulatory barriers?**  
   Compliance with industry regulations or organizational policies must be factored into your architecture to avoid potential risks.

By answering these questions, you can determine which platforms align with your needs and identify the components required to generate, track, consume, and maintain your Apache Iceberg data effectively.


## The Components of an Apache Iceberg Lakehouse

When moving to an Apache Iceberg lakehouse, certain fundamentals are a given—most notably that your data will be stored as **Parquet files** with **Iceberg metadata**. However, building a functional lakehouse requires several additional components to be carefully planned and implemented.
