In the previous post, we explored the architecture of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**—a flexible, standardized way to connect LLMs to tools, data, and workflows. One of MCP’s most powerful capabilities is its ability to expose **resources** to language models in a structured, secure, and controllable way.

In this post, we’ll dive into:
- What MCP resources are
- How they’re discovered and accessed
- Text vs binary resources
- Dynamic templates and subscriptions
- Best practices for implementation and security

If you want to give LLMs real, relevant context from your systems—without compromising safety or control—**resources** are the foundation.

## What Are Resources in MCP?

**Resources** represent data that a model or client can read.

This might include:
- Local files (e.g. `file:///logs/server.log`)
- Database records (e.g. `postgres://db/customers`)
- Web content (e.g. `https://api.example.com/data`)
- Images or screenshots (e.g. `screen://localhost/monitor1`)
- Structured system data (e.g. logs, metrics, config files)

Each resource is identified by a **URI**, and can be **read**, **discovered**, and optionally **subscribed to** for updates.

## Resource Discovery

Clients can ask a server to list available resources using:
`resources/list`

The server responds with an array of structured metadata:

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///logs/app.log",
      "name": "Application Logs",
      "description": "Recent server logs",
      "mimeType": "text/plain"
    }
  ]
}
```

Clients (or users) can browse these like a menu, selecting what context to send to the model.

### Resource Templates
In addition to static lists, servers can expose URI templates using RFC 6570 syntax:

```json
{
  "uriTemplate": "file:///logs/{date}.log",
  "name": "Log by Date",
  "description": "Access logs by date (e.g., 2024-04-01)",
  "mimeType": "text/plain"
}
```

This allows dynamic access to parameterized content—great for APIs, time-based logs, or file hierarchies.

### Reading a Resource
To retrieve the content of a resource, clients use:

`resources/read` With a payload like:

```json
{
  "uri": "file:///logs/app.log"
}
```
The server responds with the content in one of two formats:

#### Text Resource
```json
{
  "contents": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///logs/app.log",
      "mimeType": "text/plain",
      "text": "Error: Timeout on request...\n"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Binary Resource (e.g. image, PDF)
```json
{
  "contents": [
    {
      "uri": "screen://localhost/display1",
      "mimeType": "image/png",
      "blob": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Clients can choose how and when to inject these into the model’s prompt, depending on MIME type and length.

### Real-Time Updates
Resources aren’t static—they can change. MCP supports subscriptions to keep context fresh.

#### List Updates
If the list of resources changes, the server can notify the client with:

```bash
notifications/resources/list_changed
```

Useful when new logs, files, or endpoints become available.

#### Content Updates
Clients can subscribe to specific resource URIs:

```bash
resources/subscribe
```

When the resource changes, the server sends:

```bash
notifications/resources/updated
```

This is ideal for live logs, dashboards, or real-time documents.

### Security Best Practices
Exposing resources to models requires careful control. MCP includes flexible patterns for securing access:

#### Best Practices for Server Developers

- Validate all URIs: No open file reads!

- Whitelist paths or endpoints for file access

- Use descriptive names and MIME types to help clients filter content

- Provide helpful descriptions for the LLM and user

- Support URI templates for scalable access

- Audit access and subscriptions

- Avoid leaking secrets in content or metadata

#### Example: Safe Log Server
```ts
server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    resources: [
      {
        uri: "file:///logs/app.log",
        name: "App Logs",
        mimeType: "text/plain"
      }
    ]
  };
});

server.setRequestHandler(ReadResourceRequestSchema, async (request) => {
  const uri = request.params.uri;

  if (!uri.startsWith("file:///logs/")) {
    throw new Error("Access denied");
  }

  const content = await readFile(uri); // Add sanitization here
  return {
    contents: [{
      uri,
      mimeType: "text/plain",
      text: content
    }]
  };
});
```

### Why Resources Matter for AI Agents
LLMs are context-hungry. They reason better when they have:

- Real-time logs

- Source code

- System metrics

- API responses

By serving these as resources, MCP gives agents the data they need—on demand, with full user control, and without bloating prompt templates.

### Recap: Resources at a Glance

- Feature	Description
- URI-based identifiers	Unique path to each piece of content
- Text & binary support	Suitable for logs, images, PDFs, etc.
- Dynamic templates	Construct URIs on the fly
- Real-time updates	Subscriptions for changing content
- Secure access patterns	URI validation, MIME filtering, whitelisting

### Coming Up Next: Tools in MCP — Giving LLMs the Power to Act
So far, we’ve shown how MCP feeds models with data. But what if we want the model to take action?

In the next post, we’ll explore tools in MCP:

- How LLMs call functions safely

- Tool schemas and invocation patterns

- Real-world examples: shell commands, API calls, and more
