# The Cost of Neglect — How Apache Iceberg Tables Degrade Without Optimization

Apache Iceberg offers powerful features for managing large-scale datasets with reliability, versioning, and schema evolution. But like any robust system, Iceberg tables require care and maintenance. Without ongoing optimization, even the most well-designed Iceberg table can degrade—causing query slowdowns, ballooning metadata, and rising infrastructure costs.

This post kicks off a 10-part series on **Apache Iceberg Table Optimization**, beginning with a look at *what happens when you don’t optimize* and why it matters.

## Why Do Iceberg Tables Degrade?

At its core, Iceberg uses a **table metadata layer** to track the location and structure of physical files (data files, manifests, and manifest lists). Over time, various ingestion patterns—batch loads, streaming micro-batches, late-arriving records—can lead to an accumulation of inefficiencies:

### 1. **Small Files Problem**
Each write operation typically creates a new data file. In streaming or frequent ingestion pipelines, this can lead to thousands of tiny files that:
- Increase the number of file system operations during scans
- Reduce the effectiveness of predicate pushdown and pruning
- Add overhead to table metadata (larger manifest files)

### 2. **Fragmented Manifests**
Each new snapshot creates new manifest files. If the same files appear in many manifests or are not compacted, snapshot metadata becomes expensive to read and maintain.

### 3. **Bloated Snapshots**
Iceberg maintains a full history of table snapshots unless explicitly expired. Over time, this bloats the metadata layer with obsolete entries:
- Slows down time travel and rollback operations
- Inflates table size even if the data volume is static
- Consumes storage and memory unnecessarily

### 4. **Unclustered or Unsorted Data**
Without explicit clustering or sort order, files may be written in a way that scatters relevant records across multiple files. This leads to:
- Increased scan ranges and data reads during filtering
- Poor locality for analytical queries

### 5. **Partition Imbalance**
When partitions grow at uneven rates, you may end up with:
- Some partitions containing massive files
- Others being overloaded with small files
- Query planning bottlenecks on overgrown partitions

## What Are the Consequences?

These degradations manifest as tangible issues across your data platform:

- **Performance Hits:** Query scans take longer and use more compute resources.
- **Higher Costs:** More files and metadata inflate cloud storage bills and increase query processing cost in engines like Dremio, Trino, or Spark.
- **Longer Maintenance Windows:** Snapshot expiration, schema evolution, and compaction become more expensive over time.
- **Reduced Freshness and Responsiveness:** Particularly in streaming use cases, lag builds up if optimizations are not happening incrementally.

## What Causes This Degradation?

Most of these issues stem from a lack of:
- Regular **compaction**
- Snapshot and metadata **cleanup**
- Monitoring table **health metrics**
- **Clustering and layout optimization** during writes

## Looking Ahead

The good news is that Apache Iceberg provides powerful tools to fix these issues—with the right strategy. In the next posts, we’ll break down each optimization method, starting with standard compaction and how to implement it effectively.
