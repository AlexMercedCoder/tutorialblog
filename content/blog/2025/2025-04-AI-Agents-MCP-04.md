We‚Äôve explored how Large Language Models (LLMs) work, and how we can improve their performance with fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). These enhancements are powerful‚Äîbut they‚Äôre still fundamentally *stateless* and reactive.

To build systems that act with purpose, adapt over time, and accomplish multi-step goals, we need something more.

That ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is the **AI Agent**.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore:
- What AI agents are
- How they differ from LLMs
- What components make up an agent
- Real-world examples of agent use
- Why agents are a crucial next step for AI

## What Is an AI Agent?

At a high level, an **AI agent** is an autonomous or semi-autonomous system built around an LLM, capable of:
- Observing its environment (inputs, tools, data)
- Reasoning or planning
- Taking actions
- Learning or adapting over time

LLMs generate responses, but **agents make decisions**. They don‚Äôt just answer; they *think, decide, and act*.

> Think of the difference between a calculator and a virtual assistant. One gives answers. The other *gets things done*.

## The Core Ingredients of an AI Agent

Let‚Äôs break down what typically makes up an agentic system:

### 1. **LLM Core**
The brain of the operation. Handles natural language understanding and generation.

### 2. **Tools / Actions**
Agents can execute external commands, like calling APIs, querying databases, or running code.

### 3. **Memory**
Persistent memory lets agents recall previous interactions, facts, or task states.

### 4. **Planner / Executor Logic**
This is where agents shine. They can:
- Break down complex goals into subtasks
- Decide which tools or steps to take
- Loop, retry, or adapt based on results

### 5. **Context Manager**
Decides what information (memory, documents, tool results) gets included in each LLM prompt.

## LLM vs AI Agent ‚Äî Key Differences

| Capability         | LLM                  | AI Agent                          |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Input              | Prompt               | Prompt + tools + state             |
| Memory             | Ephemeral (context)  | Persistent (via external memory)   |
| Reasoning          | Single-shot          | Multi-step planning                |
| Action-taking      | No                   | Yes (tools, APIs, workflows)       |
| Autonomy           | None                 | Optional (user- or goal-directed)  |
| Adaptability       | Static behavior      | Dynamic, can learn from feedback   |

LLMs are the engine. Agents are the vehicle.

## Examples of AI Agents in the Wild

Let‚Äôs explore how AI agents are already showing up in real-world applications:

### 1. **Developer Copilots**
Tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor act as coding assistants, not just autocomplete engines. They:
- Read your project files
- Ask clarifying questions
- Suggest multi-line changes
- Run code against test cases

### 2. **Document Q&A Assistants**
Instead of just answering questions, agents:
- Search relevant documents
- Summarize findings
- Ask follow-up questions
- Offer next actions (e.g., generate reports)

### 3. **Research Agents**
Given a broad prompt like *‚Äúsummarize recent news on AI regulation,‚Äù* agents:
- Plan a research strategy
- Browse the web or internal data
- Synthesize and refine results
- Ask for confirmation before continuing

## üîÑ Agents Enable Autonomy and Feedback Loops

Unlike plain LLMs, agents can:
- Use **tools** to gather more info
- **Loop** on tasks until a condition is met
- **Store and recall** what they‚Äôve seen
- Chain multiple steps together

### For example:

**Task:** Schedule a meeting with Alice

**Agent:**

- Search calendar availability

- Find Alice‚Äôs preferred times

- Draft an email proposal

- Wait for response

- Reschedule if needed

That‚Äôs not a single LLM prompt‚Äîthat‚Äôs an intelligent system managing an evolving task.


## How Are Agents Built Today?

A number of popular **AI agent frameworks** have emerged:

- **LangChain**: Modular orchestration of LLMs, tools, and memory
- **AutoGPT**: Autonomous task completion with iterative planning
- **Semantic Kernel**: Microsoft‚Äôs framework for embedding LLMs into software
- **CrewAI / MetaGPT**: Multi-agent systems with defined roles

These frameworks let developers prototype powerful workflows, but they come with challenges‚Äîespecially around complexity, tool integration, and portability.

We‚Äôll explore those challenges in the next post.

## Limitations of Today‚Äôs Agent Implementations

While agents are promising, current frameworks have some limitations:
- **Tight coupling** to specific models or tools
- **Difficult interoperability** between agent components
- **Context juggling**: hard to manage what the model sees
- **Security and control**: risk of unsafe tool access
- **Hard to debug**: agents can go rogue or get stuck in loops

To address these, we need **standardization**‚Äîa modular way to plug in data, tools, and models securely and flexibly.

That‚Äôs where the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** enters the picture.

- How modern agent frameworks work
- What they enable (and where they fall short)
- The missing layer that MCP provides
