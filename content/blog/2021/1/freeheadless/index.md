## What is a Headless CMS

Headless CMS are applications that give you a visual dashboard for managing data but don't lock you into any particular way of building a frontend for that data. Instead, they deliver the data via an API which you can pull into the frontend application build of your choice. Headless CMS has become an integral part of the JAMStack movement and you can find a full list of Headless CMS solutions hosted and self-hosted/open source at JamStack.org.
