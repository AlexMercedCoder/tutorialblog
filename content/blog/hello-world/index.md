## Welcome

Welcome to my new Gatasby driven markdown blog! I'll be using this space mainly to create tutorials on different coding topics. In this first post I'll make an introductory tutorial to Vue.

## What is Vue?

From Vuejs.org:

> Vue (pronounced /vjuÀê/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Setup

We are going to setup a basic build using script tags this way no matter what your level you can appreciate how Vue works without having to discuss bundlers or node.

- in a folder somewhere on your computer create three files.
  - index.html
  - app.js
  - style.css

#### index.html

#### app.js

#### style.css
